# LineCounter
Counts significant lines in code.
Significant lines are lines that aren't curly braces, import statements, class definitions, etc.
This isn't a complex project, just wanted a tool to count up lines of code.
I'm also aware that "lines of code" isn't a very good metric to judge code complexity
